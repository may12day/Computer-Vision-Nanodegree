## Project Overview

### Introduction
In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

### Getting the project files
You can also choose to complete this project in your own local repository (and may use GPU, there), and you can find all of the project files in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints).
